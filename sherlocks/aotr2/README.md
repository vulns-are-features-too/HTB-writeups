> These three words correspond to the exact GPS coordinates. Use your phone to decode them ONCE, then delete your search history. The spot is by an old concrete pier with faded anchor graffiti. You cannot miss it.

A simple Google search ([normal search](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22twitchy+develop+hulk%22) or [maps](https://www.google.com/maps/search/twitchy+develop+hulk)) doesn't work.

Looking at [the Wikipedia for GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#Alternative_encodings), [what3words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What3words) seems to match the 3-word phrase scheme.
We can use [what3words.com](https://what3words.com/twitchy.develop.hulk) to find the coordinates.
